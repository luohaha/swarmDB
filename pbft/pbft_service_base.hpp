        /*
         * Interface for some service that is replicated by pbft. There could a layer that just handles the logic
         * required by this interface, but if the underlying service is a database than that would probably be awkward.
         *
         * Caller must guarantee:
         * - If apply_operation(x, y) is called, then apply_operation(x2, y) will never be called with x != x2
         * - If apply_operation(_, y) is called and y != 0, then apply_operation(_, y-1) will be called at least once
         *     (may be before or after apply_operation(_, y).
         * - If consolidate_log(y) is called, then no subsequenent call to query(x, y2) will have y2 < y
         *     (so the service may consolidate all the updates before y into a single version of the service on disk)
         * - consolidate_log(y) is called if forall y2<y, apply_operation(_, y2) has already been called
         * - After consolidate_log(y) is called, no future call apply_operation(_, y2) or query(_, y2)
         *     or consolidate_log(y2) will have y2 < y
         *
         * Implementation must guarantee:
         * - If apply_operation(x, y) is called with y != 0, the request will not be executed until after the request
         *     supplied in the call apply_operation(x2, y-1).
         * - When apply_operation(x, y) is called, it will be persisted to disk before the method returns even if
         *     x cannot yet be executed due to the first constraint
         * - The result of query(x, y) is the result of applying x against the version of the service where every
         *   operation with sequence number <= y has been applied, except operations that cannot yet be applied
         *   due to the first constraint. So, where cp is the last call to consolidate_log(cp) and curr is the last
         *   executed request sequence number, when query(x, y) is called, assuming the service is crud:
         *      if y >= curr, use the most up to date version of the key you have applied (still obeying constraint 1)
         *      if curr > y > cp, use the most up to date version of the key written before y, or the stable checkpoint
         *        if it hasn't been written to in that interval
         *      if cp == y, use the version of the key from the stable checkpoint
         *      if cp > y, the caller has broken a constraint
         * - Operations are applied at most once (crud operations are idempotent anyway)
         *
         * Notably not guarenteed:
         *  - apply_operation(x, y) called only once for the same value y
         *  - apply_operation(x, y) called with monotomically increasing y
